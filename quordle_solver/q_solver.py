"""
quordle_solver/q_solver.py

Interactive Quordle-style helper (4 Wordles at once).
- You enter a single guess; all four boards use that guess.
- Then you paste the feedback for EACH board (g/y/b, 2/1/0, or [0,1,2,2,0]).
- The solver prunes each board's candidate pool and recommends the next guess
  by minimizing the SUM of expected remaining across all *unsolved* boards.
- Repeats until all boards are solved or you quit.

Run:
  python -m quordle_solver.q_solver --csv word_list.csv

Shortcuts:
  quit / q / exit  -> exit at any prompt
